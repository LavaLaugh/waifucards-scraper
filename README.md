# waifucards-scraper
A future scraper for waifucards.app witch only shows the characters that you have 1(one) or more cards of.

# Install
1. Install Python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Linux already includes Python).
2. Copy and place the repo in a folder that you can easily reach, e.g. Documents.

# Usage
For now, it takes some manual work to make it work, but I am planning to make it a webscraper ... eventually.

1. Go to your user profile and click on album, or use the link and replace "[username]" with your username: https://waifucards.app/user/[username]?items=120&collection=has#cards-box
..* Expand the view to 120 cards, or use the link and replace "[username]" with your username.
